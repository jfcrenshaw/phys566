I plan to use the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) as a lens to investigate other optimization methods.

Outline:
1. Set up the TSP
2. exact solution
3. computationally expensive
    - computational expense grows like n! which is faster than exponential
    - (basically) impossible to find exact solution for large n
4. simulated annealing
5. genetic algorithm
6. ant colony optimization
7. other applications
    - TSP problem in physics
    - examples of other uses of these optimization methods

Discrete optimizations
- scheduling jobs on a server/super-computer
